    """Sampling parameters for text generation.

    Overall, we follow the sampling parameters from the OpenAI text completion
    API (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).
    In addition, we support multiple additional samplers which are not supported
    by OpenAI.

    Args:
        n: Number of output sequences to return for the given prompt.
        best_of: Number of output sequences that are generated from the prompt.
            From these `best_of` sequences, the top `n` sequences are returned.
            `best_of` must be greater than or equal to `n`. This is treated as
            the beam width when `use_beam_search` is True. By default, `best_of`
            is set to `n`.
        presence_penalty: Float that penalizes new tokens based on whether they
            appear in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage the model
            to use new tokens, while values < 0 encourage the model to repeat
            tokens.
        frequency_penalty: Float that penalizes new tokens based on their
            frequency in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage the
            model to use new tokens, while values < 0 encourage the model to
            repeat tokens.
        repetition_penalty: Float that penalizes new tokens based on their
            frequency in the generated text so far.
            freq_pen is applied additively while
            rep_pen is applied multiplicatively.
            Must be in [1, inf). Set to 1 to disable the effect.
        no_repeat_ngram_size: Size of the n-grams to prevent repeating.
            1 would mean no token can appear twice.
            2 would mean no pair of consecutive tokens can appear twice.
        temperature: Float that controls the randomness of the sampling. Lower
            values make the model more deterministic, while higher values make
            the model more random. Zero means greedy sampling.
        top_p: Float that controls the cumulative probability of the top tokens
            to consider. Must be in (0, 1]. Set to 1 to consider all tokens.
        top_k: Integer that controls the number of top tokens to consider. Set
            to -1 to consider all tokens.
        top_a: Float that controls the cutoff for Top-A sampling.
            Exact cutoff is top_a*max_prob**2. Must be in [0,inf], 0 to disable.
        min_p: Float that controls the cutoff for min-p sampling.
            Exact cutoff is min_p*max_prob. Must be in [0,1], 0 to disable.
        tfs: Float that controls the cumulative approximate curvature of the
            distribution to retain for Tail Free Sampling.
            Must be in (0, 1]. Set to 1 to disable
        eta_cutoff: Float that controls the cutoff threshold for Eta sampling
            (a form of entropy adaptive truncation sampling)
            threshold is computed as min(eta, sqrt(eta)*entropy(probs)).
            Specified in units of 1e-4. Set to 0 to disable
        epsilon_cutoff: Float that controls the cutoff threshold for
            Epsilon sampling (simple probability threshold truncation).
            Specified in units of 1e-4. Set to 0 to disable.
        typical_p: Float that controls the cumulative probability of tokens
            closest in surprise to the expected surprise to consider.
            Must be in (0, 1]. Set to 1 to disable.
        mirostat_mode: Can either be 0 (disabled) or 2 (Mirostat v2).
        mirostat_tau: Target "surprisal" that mirostat works towards.
            Range [0, inf).
        mirostat_eta: Rate at which mirostat updates its internal surprisal
            value. Range [0, inf).
        dynatemp_min: Minimum temperature for dynatemp sampling.
            Range [0, inf).
        dynatemp_max: Maximum temperature for dynatemp sampling.
            Range [0, inf).
        dynatemp_exponent: Exponent for dynatemp sampling. Range [0, inf).
        smoothing_factor: Smoothing factor for Quadratic Sampling.
        smoothing_curve: Smoothing curve for Quadratic (Cubic) Sampling.
        seed: Random seed to use for the generation.
        use_beam_search: Whether to use beam search instead of sampling.
        length_penalty: Float that penalizes sequences based on their length.
            Used in beam search.
        early_stopping: Controls the stopping condition for beam search. It
            accepts the following values: `True`, where the generation stops as
            soon as there are `best_of` complete candidates; `False`, where an
            heuristic is applied and the generation stops when is it very
            unlikely to find better candidates; `"never"`, where the beam search
            procedure only stops when there cannot be better candidates
            (canonical beam search algorithm).
        stop: List of strings that stop the generation when they are generated.
            The returned output will not contain the stop strings.
        stop_token_ids: List of tokens that stop the generation when they are
            generated. The returned output will contain the stop tokens unless
            the stop tokens are special tokens.
        include_stop_str_in_output: Whether to include the stop strings in
            output text. Defaults to False.
        ignore_eos: Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating
            tokens after the EOS token is generated.
        max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens to generate per output sequence.
        min_tokens: Minimum number of tokens to generate per output sequence
            before EOS or stop tokens are generated.
        logprobs: Number of log probabilities to return per output token.
            When set to None, no probability is returned. If set to a non-None
            value, the result includes the log probabilities of the specified
            number of most likely tokens, as well as the chosen tokens.
            Note that the implementation follows the OpenAI API: The API will
            always return the log probability of the sampled token, so there
            may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.
        prompt_logprobs: Number of log probabilities to return per prompt token.
        detokenize: Whether to detokenize the output. Defaults to True.
        custom_token_bans: List of token IDs to ban from generating
        skip_special_tokens: Whether to skip special tokens in the output.
            defaults to true.
        spaces_between_special_tokens: Whether to add spaces between special
            tokens in the output. Defaults to True.
        logits_processors: List of functions that modify logits based on
            previously generated tokens, and optionally prompt tokens as
            a first argument.
        truncate_prompt_tokens: If set to an integer k, will use only the last
            k tokens from the prompt (i.e. left-truncation). Defaults to None
            (i.e. no truncation).
        xtc_threshold: In XTC sampling, if 2 or more tokens have probability
            above this threshold, consider removing all but the last one.
        xtc_probability: Probability that the removal will actually happen.
            0 disables the sampler, 1 makes it always happen.
        nsigma: Number of standard deviations from the maximum logit to use
            as a cutoff threshold. Tokens with logits below
            (max_logit - nsgima * std_dev) are filtered out. Higher values
            (e.g. 3.0) keep more tokens, lower values (e.g. 1.0) are more
            selective. Must be positive. 0 to disable.
        dry_multiplier: Float that controls the magnitude of the DRY sampling
            penalty. Higher values create stronger penalties against
            repetition. The penalty is multiplied by this value before being
            applied. Must be non-negative. 0 disables the sampler.
        dry_base: Base for the exponential growth of the DRY sampling penalty.
            Controls how quickly the penalty increases with longer repeated
            sequences. Must be greater than 1. Higher values (e.g. 2.0) create
            more aggressive penalties for longer repetitions. Defaults to 1.75.
        dry_allowed_length: Maximum number of tokens that can be repeated
            without incurring a DRY sampling penalty. Sequences longer than
            this will be penalized exponentially. Must be at least 1.
            Defaults to 2.
        dry_sequence_breaker_ids: List of token IDs that stop
            the matching of repeated content. These tokens will break up the
            input into sections where repetition is evaluated separately.
            Common examples are newlines, quotes, and other structural tokens.
            Defaults to None.
        dry_range: The range of tokens (input + output) to apply the DRY
            sampler.
        skew: Bias the token selection towards higher or lower probability
            tokens. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
        sampler_priority: A list of integers to control the order in which
            samplers are applied.
